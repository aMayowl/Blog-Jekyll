# XXCCXX

It's election time in many countries this year. Belgium is one of those countries though, granted, not the most important one. Recently, while following some debates between parties on specific issues, I found myself agreeing with both sides of the problem/solution. 

And the results of these thoughts was the power of the written words, mine: write a blog post asking myself the question "Do I Agree With This?" (DIAWT). My goal will therefore be to question whether I agree with a statement, dig more information on the topic in question and share what I learned here.

# That's it?

I don't know. I tend to believe that I'm not creative enough to write inspiring blog posts from the blue. This way, it provides me an easy source of inspiration since I'm documenting those types of questions regularly.

In a perfect world, I'll find other stuff to write about. My overall goal is to develop a writing muscle first. Second will be the quality of what I write and, lastly, the reach. I'm writing for myself for now.
