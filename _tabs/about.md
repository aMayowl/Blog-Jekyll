# Who am I?

My name is Ben, originally from Belgium and living in Berlin at the moment.

Curious and huge consumer of content, I want to become creator of content. Not because I believe that I have something special to say but to create something out of the consumption, at least. Also, I have a theory that people don't think for themselves, they study/swallow tons of advices and give them away as if they thought about this long and hard. Let's see if I can do better.

# What to expect?

Hard to tell, really. I'm a legal counsel in tech so those topics interest me. I love geopolitics as well and even more so when all of that intersect (hello export controls). Realistically, I'll react to things I hear/read and ask myself if I agree with it.
